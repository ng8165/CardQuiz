# CardQuiz

In an attempt to not pay for Quizlet Plus, I have decided to try to remake Quizlet.

This app uses Next.js, Bootstrap, and Firebase Cloud Firestore to store quizzes.

### Current Features

- add and delete quizzes
- add, edit, and delete cards
- Flashcards mode

### Todo

- card flipping animation in Flashcards mode
- Firebase Auth
    - allow quizzes to be private
- beautify
- Write mode
- Test mode
